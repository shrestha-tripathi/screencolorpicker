# ColorTrail — SEO Keyword Corpus & FAQ Master

Generated 2026-06-08 from Google autocomplete API research. This is the
canonical source for all FAQ Q&As, landing-page keyword targets, and blog
post topics. Update this file FIRST when adding new content, then mirror
into the relevant pages.

## 1. Keyword difficulty cheat sheet

Demand signal: Google autocomplete depth (1-10). 10 = max return = high
intent. Use this as a free proxy for keyword volume when Ahrefs/SEMrush
aren't available.

## 2. Keywords by intent bucket

## 3. FAQ master corpus (canonical source)

These get rendered into:
1. The on-page FAQ section on home (top 6, below the tool)
2. The dedicated `/faq` page (all of them) with FAQPage schema
3. Spread across landing pages by intent (OKLCH FAQs on `/oklch-color-picker` etc.)

### Q1. What is the EyeDropper API and why doesn't every browser have it?

The EyeDropper API is a browser-native feature (`window.EyeDropper`) that
turns the cursor into a system-wide color picker. It can sample any pixel
on screen — including outside the browser, across multiple monitors — and
requires zero permissions. Chrome shipped it in 2021 (v95), followed by
Edge, Brave, and Opera. Firefox publicly declined to implement it (Mozilla
position: "negative"), and Safari hasn't signaled interest yet. For those
browsers, ColorTrail's Screenshot Picker fills the gap by using the
universally-supported getDisplayMedia API.

### Q2. How do I use ColorTrail to pick a color from anywhere on my screen?

Click the rainbow "Pick a color" button. Your cursor instantly becomes a
precision eyedropper. Move it over any pixel on your entire screen — your
IDE, Photoshop, a YouTube video, a PDF, another monitor — and click to
capture. The HEX, RGB, HSL, and OKLCH values appear instantly with
one-click copy. Or press the keyboard shortcut `P` from anywhere on the
page.

### Q3. The eyedropper cancels when I switch tabs. How do I pick from another tab?

Use the "Pick from screenshot" button next to the live picker. It uses
the `getDisplayMedia` API to capture one frozen frame from any window,
tab, or screen you choose — then you can leisurely pick colors from that
frame with a built-in 10× magnifier. The live EyeDropper API is locked
to whatever's visible at click-time and cancels on focus loss; that's a
browser security constraint, not a ColorTrail one.

### Q4. Is ColorTrail really free? What's the catch?

100% free, forever. No accounts, no signup, no ads, no upsells, no Pro
tier. Your colors never leave your device — everything runs in your
browser via the native EyeDropper and getDisplayMedia APIs. We don't
collect, store, or transmit any color data you pick. The project is
open-source on GitHub.

### Q5. Can ColorTrail or any third party see the colors I pick?

No. Both the EyeDropper API and getDisplayMedia API are fully
client-side — pixel data stays in JavaScript running in your browser,
never sent over the network. Your palette history is stored in your
browser's localStorage and never leaves your device. Captured screenshot
frames are held in browser memory only and freed when you close the
modal.

### Q6. What is OKLCH and why should I care?

OKLCH is a perceptually uniform color space introduced in 2020 by Björn
Ottosson. CSS Color Level 4 (2023+) supports it natively. It produces
predictable color manipulations — lightening or darkening a color by the
same amount perceptually looks like the same amount of change. Modern
design systems (Tailwind v4, OpenProps) increasingly use OKLCH for color
tokens. Most online color pickers don't expose OKLCH; we do.

### Q7. Why doesn't the live picker work in Firefox or Safari?

Firefox and Safari haven't shipped the EyeDropper API yet. Mozilla's
official position is that they don't plan to implement it; WebKit (Safari)
hasn't signaled support either. For those browsers, use "Pick from
screenshot" — `getDisplayMedia` is universally supported (Chrome 72+,
Firefox 66+, Safari 13+, Edge 79+).

### Q8. Is ColorTrail safe to use? Why is it better than browser extensions?

ColorTrail uses zero browser permissions, can't read any of your other
tabs, and runs entirely client-side. Browser extensions like ColorZilla
require "read all data on the websites you visit" — a permission that
lets them read passwords, banking pages, anything. The browser-native
EyeDropper API is sandboxed and only returns the pixel color, not the
surrounding context.

### Q9. Does ColorTrail work offline?

After your browser has loaded the page once, ColorTrail works fully
offline. It's a static site with no backend — no API calls, no analytics
pings, no remote dependencies needed at runtime. Install it as a
bookmark for instant offline access; we recommend installing as a PWA
for fastest launch.

### Q10. Can I pick colors from a PDF or video?

Yes. The live EyeDropper picks any visible pixel — including PDFs open
in your browser or system PDF reader, video frames paused in any player,
streamed content, and images in any app. For paused videos in another
tab, Screenshot mode captures the exact frame you want without focus
loss.

### Q11. Does ColorTrail support color blindness or contrast checking?

Not yet — we're considering a WCAG contrast checker and color blindness
simulation modes in a future release. For now, every color output
displays in 4 formats simultaneously (HEX, RGB, HSL, OKLCH) so you can
plug them into your favorite contrast checker.

### Q12. Can I export my palette to Figma, Tailwind, or a design file?

Export is on our roadmap (CSS variables, Tailwind tokens, JSON, .ase
Adobe Swatch Exchange). For now, your palette is saved in browser
localStorage and you can copy individual colors in any of the 4 formats
with one click.

### Q13. How accurate is the color sampling? Does it match Photoshop?

Pixel-perfect. The EyeDropper API returns the exact sRGB color of the
sampled pixel, identical to what tools like Photoshop's Eyedropper or
macOS Digital Color Meter return for the same pixel. Screenshot mode
also samples directly from the captured bitmap with no compression.

### Q14. Does ColorTrail work on mobile?

Partially. On mobile Chrome (Android), the EyeDropper API exists but
can only sample inside the current browser tab — not from other apps.
For full-screen sampling, use a desktop browser. The Screenshot Picker
works on mobile too, but mobile browsers offer fewer capture sources
than desktop.

### Q15. What browsers support window.EyeDropper as of 2026?

Chrome 95+ (Oct 2021), Edge 95+, Brave (1.32+), Opera 81+, Arc, Vivaldi,
and any Chromium-based browser. Firefox: no, with no plans. Safari: no
signal. Mobile Chromium: tab-only sampling. Check
[caniuse.com/eyedropper-api](https://caniuse.com/?search=eyedropper) for
real-time status.

### Q16. How is ColorTrail different from ColorZilla?

ColorZilla is a Chrome extension that requires "read all data on the
websites you visit" permission, is ad-injected in the free tier, and
only works inside the browser tab where it's installed. ColorTrail is
a zero-install website that uses your browser's native EyeDropper API,
requires no permissions, works system-wide (outside the browser too),
has no ads, and supports OKLCH out of the box.

### Q17. Why "ColorTrail"? What's with the name?

"Trail" because we save your recent palette as you go — a trail of
colors you've picked. We're a tiny one-tap utility, not a full design
suite. Less is the moat.

### Q18. What's the difference between HEX, RGB, HSL, and OKLCH?

HEX (#RRGGBB) is a compact text encoding of RGB — most common in web
code. RGB (red, green, blue) is the device-native format. HSL (hue,
saturation, lightness) is more intuitive for humans to manipulate but
isn't perceptually uniform. OKLCH (lightness, chroma, hue) is the
modern perceptually-uniform choice, recommended for design systems
shipping in 2024+. ColorTrail shows all four for every color you pick,
so you can copy whichever matches your codebase or design tool.

## 5. Anti-patterns

- **Do not** dump all 18 FAQs on the home page — it becomes a wall of
  text and dilutes the conversion-focused hero. Top 6 only; rest live on `/faq`.
- **Do not** spin up landing pages for every long-tail (`/color-picker-from-screen-mac` etc.) — Google now penalizes thin doorway pages. Keep the long-tails as `<section>`s WITHIN a parent landing page.
- **Do not** stuff keywords into headings. Each h2 should read naturally
  to a human first.
- **Do not** create blog posts shorter than 800 words — they don't rank.

## 6. Maintenance

Re-run keyword research (`autocomplete` script in
`prebuild-spec-validation` skill) quarterly. Browser API support changes
faster than we expect (especially Safari). Update Q15 in this file
whenever caniuse.com data changes.
